**Info**

This Java project implements a Heartrate Recommendation System (IRS). It has a crud functionality where adding,displaying, deleting and updating both patients and users is possible.It project was developed with an mvc development pattern. However, the folder structure isn't set to reflect the MVC model. I kept the model, view and controller classes in the src directory in irs package. It's requires jfoenix and mysql's jdbc driver libraries to run and these external libraries are included in the lib directory. The build.xml file is purely for automation purpose. You can run this project in one of the following two ways:     1. Download src and lib directory only and add the jfoenix and mysql jdbc connector to the classpath and execute the project from your prefered text editor.

     2. Download src, lib and build.xml and add the jfoenix and mysql jdbc connector libraries in the lib folder to the classpath - execute the project from cmd using the apache ant automation tool.  

```1. compile
2.1 compile
2.2 run
```



This will run the project and will create the build directory where in which the classes and jar directories are created.
